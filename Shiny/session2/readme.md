This week we will be looking into reactivity within shiny applications. 

We are referencing lots of free online material - as always!
[R shiny interactivity overview](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/reactivity-overview.html)

[The example R shiny apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/basics.html)


You can run the example apps in shiny using the below code:

```markdown

`library(shiny)`
#this will show you all the example apps you can run
`runExample()`

#to run an example simply put the app name in "" within the runExample() e.g.
`runExample("01_hello")`

```
